# CryptoCushion

This project is a GraphQL api built on Hapi.js with a React Native skeleton frontend that can connect to Coinbase as well as the Plaid banking api for the purpose of helping less savvy crypto-currency users automatically round up their banking transactions and place them in Bitcoin.
